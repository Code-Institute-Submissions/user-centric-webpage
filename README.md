<h1>User Centric Model - Resume Website.</h1>
This is my website project which I am developing for the User Centric Model of my Code Insistute cource. I am creating a website that can be used as a resume webpage and has the use of only HTML and CSS.

This webpage will be a set goal where I will create a very welcoming webpage that has a very broad audience and is able to be used on different devices and web browsers.
<h2>Introudction</h2>
Within this project I would like to create a website that is able to be used as my resume website. This sight will contain personal information that employers would like to learn about me which would help them to be able to make descisions on whether I would be a worthy employee or someone they would like to hire.

There are certain things that I would like to aim for with this webpage and try to set targets that can be achieved through an end goal.
<ul>
    <li>
        I must create a website that has a simple and easy navigation which is at the core of the website.
    </li>
        The website must contain the information about me within subsections which are named correctly and are needed by the emoployer
    <li>
        The websites design and layout must be well structured and have a very universal design that alteres to include the different devices and web browsers.
    </li>
        The design and structure must stay true and be simple to use to be able to allow users to understand more from the website and be able to learn and not become overwhelmed.
    <li>
        The layout must stay consistant throughtout the different subsections.
    </li>
</ul>

I would produce a webpage that encapsualates and presents to an employers that I can create a webpage that is both informing and also universal and has a reactive and creative design.
I would like to also include any information about the experience I have had as programming and have the ability to place small snippets of alternative websites and codes.

The website must be able to show everything about me from my experience to my education which I currently have. This has to be a webpage that is up-to-date.

<h2>Development</h2>
I have began by creating a simple but effective navigation bar, I would prefer to add a fundimental css to create the layout and structure before customising and designing the website and its theme.
I like to always use the bordering around each of the items in the page to be able to see hit boxes and the space on which they take. This allows for me to try and create the page depending on there the item sits on the webpage.

Next I begin by inserting a simple bit of text, image and a title and begin to alter and customise the layout, I am aiming to create the layout of the item so that both the image and text get equal amounts of visual space and neither of the items are neglected or overlooked.
I need to make sure that each item is placed so that I can work on smaller devices and also present on bigger devices. I like to make it that mobile version of the website is simplified version of the webpage that is displayed on the desktop versions of the website.
I would also like to make sure the theme and layout is continous and consistant.

When creating a website I love to create the css and html side-by-side, as this allows for me to create the in-line style and out-of-line style. It also helps to create classes and find out similarities in classess.
For example I had a class called profile-image and then I needed several other styles of image borders, so I also needed to include the alternate classess and gave them better naming conventions.
So the profile image which gave a circular image border could be named circle-image, and then round-img and square-img. This allows for me to create a range of different classes. This helps prevent recessive coding.
When you begin coding you must always try and see how your code can be improved and how important it is. Naming conventions are very useful as the names allow for simple but yet effect description.
For example, the choice of the naming convention, circle-image instead of profile-image. This would mean that the general style is not for one specific image but something that is more generalised.
I like to create sets of classes which opens a range of options, so I may not need things like sqaure-img, but this may come in handy down the line of development.

I have created a timeline which is included on the experience page, I would like to use this timeline to present the information in a formal manner. Which follows the times of each of the places that I have worked.
Also began to alter the layout of each of the of the individual pages to show a similar but unique look to the different parts of the website.
Included some space for links within the contact page, this is for extra information like the cv and other important documents.
I have done a few changes to some of the different layouts and tried to begin to create a controll for the tables so the content is placed within a specific size and allows for thwe content not to collide, I am also trying to create other design differences and began to try the media enquiry.
Once I had created the layout of the webpage, I had created it on a pc, and noticed that tables don't function properly on smaller devices, so I choice to create a table which is using div's and gave them corresponding names in the css to allow for them to function like a table.
Original I was planning on just creating and forming the layout of the webpage but now I am trying to use the different media fields to allow for me to create a suitable webpage. Now that the table has become div's I am able to control and change more about the layout.
Now the page has its general layout. I want to make sure that I have got the highest control of the webpage so the use of tables in this instances would begin to completecate and sometimes ruin the page. In this instance we are using classess and display types to general a table that turns div containers into the containers.
This would allow me to have higher control of how these div containers and there children should behave. I want to make sure that the webpage has a smooth but basic layout and has simple but effective changes between mobile and tablet versions of the website.
I have also added an alternative image class and traditional image class which allows for me to change the layout of how the text and image is present. I want it so that the images and the text are grouped, but this can not be done on mobile versions as the images and text can not be displayed on the same line as this would cause too much of the display to be taken up and over used.
This means that you would begin to view the page on a mobile device and would begin to see the images and then text so that they are visual grouped together.
Also beginning to finish the general layout of the mobile version of the webpage, as this would probably be the only device other than tablet that I'd like to make for. The only page layout changes that need to be present usually are when objects are not laid out as intended by the creator, and all of the objects now behave correctly across the different platforms.
This can mean I can start to work on the actual style of the page and fill in the text and images.

Changed a few different atrributes like the height of the overview and about page so that when users come to the page it would be the main part of there page that they see. I'd Like to make sure that user only sees sections at a time and can't begin to see the next section.
Also filled in the text on the experience page so that I can try and scale the timeline div so that it has the correct height.

Continue to complete and fill in the different pages, I am going to finish the other pages and then try and create a simplified overview on the overview page, to give the user a taste of what the webpage contains.
I want to make sure that I begin with the education and experience pages first and then begin to work on the other pages afterwards.
