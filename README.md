<h1>User Centric Model - Resume Website.</h1>
This is my website project which I am developing for the User Centric Model of my Code Insistute cource. I am creating a website that can be used as a resume webpage and has the use of only HTML and CSS.

This webpage will be a set goal where I will create a very welcoming webpage that has a very broad audience and is able to be used on different devices and web browsers.
<h2>Introudction</h2>
Within this project I would like to create a website that is able to be used as my resume website. This sight will contain personal information that employers would like to learn about me which would help them to be able to make descisions on whether I would be a worthy employee or someone they would like to hire.

There are certain things that I would like to aim for with this webpage and try to set targets that can be achieved through an end goal.
<ul>
    <li>
        I must create a website that has a simple and easy navigation which is at the core of the website.
    </li>
        The website must contain the information about me within subsections which are named correctly and are needed by the emoployer
    <li>
        The websites design and layout must be well structured and have a very universal design that alteres to include the different devices and web browsers.
    </li>
        The design and structure must stay true and be simple to use to be able to allow users to understand more from the website and be able to learn and not become overwhelmed.
    <li>
        The layout must stay consistant throughtout the different subsections.
    </li>
</ul>

I would produce a webpage that encapsualates and presents to an employers that I can create a webpage that is both informing and also universal and has a reactive and creative design.
I would like to also include any information about the experience I have had as programming and have the ability to place small snippets of alternative websites and codes.

The website must be able to show everything about me from my experience to my education which I currently have. This has to be a webpage that is up-to-date.

I have began by creating a simple but effective navigation bar, I would prefer to add a fundimental css to create the layout and structure before customising and designing the website and its theme.
I like to always use the bordering around each of the items in the page to be able to see hit boxes and the space on which they take. This allows for me to try and create the page depending on there the item sits on the webpage.
