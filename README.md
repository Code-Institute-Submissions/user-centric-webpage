<h1>User Centric Module - Resume Webpage</h1>
For this module, I have been instructed to create a webpage that utilises HTML and CSS and creates an interactive and constructive webpage, which works across platforms and devices.
In this module, you are able to use either a HTML, CSS editor or a bootstrap or another styling grid flow addon. The use of bootstrap is completly optional and you dont have to use any form of grid-flow addon within the development of your website.
This would be to help you during the module and for later on in your development career as layout modifiers or styling sheets are used by several companies to make website development more robust and accessable. Not just that the website is easier to maintain and repair in future reference.
I had original created a webpage using bootstrap but after some time creating a website, I began to feel somewhat restricted. Even though these types of languages do allow for cross-platform support they dont offer more of a control on the general overal product and development.
Its like creating a structure that you would then begin to build over using a styling sheet. Its helpful to use these types of languages but means that you would have to create several changes to the way you create the page.

I went for the idea of creating a professional webpage, like a resume website. In this website I would create a place where companies could go to learn about me and be able to show them my abilities as a programmer. I wanted to make sure that I created a website that followed the rules places by the module and follow rules that I apply during development or during planning.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr>

In this module you where assigned to create a webpage that is versitile and accessable from different web browsers and devices. You must make sure that the website is able to behave as intended across platform so that the user can always access what the developer is trying to create and produce.
You must make sure that you test your website during all of development to make sure that changes to the website are set and work according to the different places you try it from.

During this module, I wanted to follow some rules set by the course and by myself.
These rules help me create an idea and encapsulate a creation that holds true to what I want from the website and what users would like to see.
For this module,  you must try to create an interactive site using CSS or grid-styling sheet or flow language to be able to make this universal site.
Along with this rule, I wanted to make a few of my own.

The website can be accessed on a link which is created and hosted by GitHub which is where the website is stored and accessed.
<a href="https://roy-finch.github.io/user-centric-webpage/">Active Resume Website</a>
For the source code to the webpage it can be accessed on the GitHub index.html file.
Source Code (index.html) - <a href="index.html">index</a>

There is a seperate file which talks about development of the website and any issues faced during its development. This log is updated with a general guide of how the website was created or any features that are created and what issues I have faced.

Update Log - <a href="update_log.md">update_log</a>
<ul>
    <li>
        I wanted to begin by creating the general structure of the site. This included planning how the styling would behave and how things like navigation would flow.
        I started by creating a plan of the different parts of the website that I'd like to include, for example, an overview which is the home page, an about page to get personal information and updates and also an education and experience page where people can learn about my professional background.
    </li>
    <li>
        I wanted to make sure that the style was true and continued throughout the document. I also wanted to make a website that stayed within the index.html, and would have a form of navigation to take the user through the file. This is to make editing easier and also I feel like it controls the flow of the user and allows for the developer to take the user down the website so as they read the information it slowly begins to allow them to learn about me and who I am.
    </li>
    <li>
        The design of the page would be made so its simple to read and the sections of each site are seperated properly, and each of the webpages, like experience and education can be made in a format that will allow for future development and future updates.
    </li>
    <li>
        I also wanted to style the website either as a traditional webpage or a form of word document or online CV or word editor, so each of the pages are like pieces of paper which contain the information in a natural and less forced manor.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Initial Consept</h2>
I would like to create a personal and professional webpage that gives an employers my background and allows for them to be able to access a series of pages which provide information about me as a person, along with my skills and abilities which could benefit a user that accesses and views my site.
I want to create webpage that is visually effective and doesn't become overly complecated and is minimised and factual.
In this webpage I want users to be able to access this information across platform, and I want them to be able to view the website in the pre-determind layout which I set using the structure.
I want the website to be structure so that its like reading a publication or CV, with clear and effective names, titles and text. The information included has to have a specific or general connection to each title.
The webpages must keep across a topic, and provide enough information to the user to learn about my experience but not too much information so that it becomes overwhelming. Simple but effective layouts must be used to break up information on pages like education and experience so that it is easier to read.

I want a webpage that is not to hard to read and is able to be understood by the user. It must not have redundant or inaffective stratagys to take the users attention but the layout must keep the viewer flowing through the site going from page to page, element to element.
I want to make sure that all files and links are included and documents like CV and forms of contact are included for if a user would like to learn more information about me.
<h2>Development</h2>
<hr>
I have changed and modified the README file so that there are two .md files located along side the website to offer insight to the general development choices. I also wanted to show and present the purpose and effective illustrate what is required during this module. The other file will be to create a development log of changes that have been done to make sure that the website is maintained and to state why these changes have been compeleted.

At the beginning I created a workspace on GitPod using the example provided by Code Institute, and made a copy within a local GitPod workspace and began to make and program my webpage.
I wanted to start by thinking about how the design would flow.
I began creating wireframes for two consepts that I wanted to create in my website.
I original was going to create the website as a generic website layout and begin to alter it and give a custom style to it, but settled for the second option.
I chose the second option as I felt like during development this would be easier to modify and more versitile. As I wanted to have some form of control over the users information path. I wanted them to read this as an autobiography or book of some form and read it. As they read on, their interest may begin to peak and the user would read on.
On mobile versions of the site I knew that I could make the website begin to funnel the information into a single row instead of having images and text side by side.
This still ment the user would come to the image and then the overview first and then lead to the paragraphs and bullet points of text under neither so that the user is able to read on and continue to learn about what I have to offer.
Then as they move through the pages, the About or about me page would be about personal life and give them an insight to who I am and how I work.
The other two pages where for education and experience.
I wanted these two sites to have a versitile design and a simple ability to be added to in later versions.
I wanted this because these two websites would always change and the information would begin to build for these two sites. Having the designs and the code layouts begin versitile means that through development in the future the site is easily updated with personal or profressional information.

Whilst working through the flow I would begin by creating a simple but effective CSS style which I label, "hit box and bounds" which referes to the idea of where each of the div containers and other tags will sit on the page and what space they would take up. Allowing for the development of the site to be easier, as understanding the size of the elements allowed for an easier customisation.

<a href="https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/93b8ebda0383695">Wireframe 1</a>

This is my first wireframe. It gave more of a website feel than a webpage. I original wanted this design, but later in development and planning I began to realise the functionality and controllability of this site.
I noticed that navigation on this site was easier than on site two, I also came to the idea of creating a nav bar that would possibly be on the left hand side of the website. After testing this on smaller devices it wasn't helpful for mobile users and took up too much screen space.
Also when simplifying the website and modifying it for mobile devices, I noticed that It didnt begin to have flow as I originaly intended and in fact made the sight feel too open and allowed for the user to begin to go from page to page without reading into the text and learn who I am.
I enjoyed the overal ability to customise this site more than the second frame but as functionality across different devices came around I thought that this design would be more of a hinderance than a benefit. As you would create this site on smaller devices
it would mean that the user is made to read the information in a more linear fasion as the navigation bar would sit on the left hand side. I want to make sure that the experience isnt extremely different depending on the device the user may use. I noticed that it felt like the screen was overly filled and was more offensive to the eyes. I wanted the webpage to have more of a simplified feel but on the smaller devices this didn't feel possible.

<a href="https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/441f29bf9384111">Wireframe 2</a>

This is wireframe two, this site had less of a navigation ability than the other website but allowed for the website to look more like a publication or book. This is what I intended to create as its more profressional and gives more of a simple but yet effective design.
I felt like creating a webpage, which had a layout that was intended to show and present a beginning overview of factual information about me in both a personal and professional sense. I then wanted to allow the user to be able to then use the webpage to begin to search for more information about me and about where I've worked and the subjects I have learned.
I also felt like this design allowed for future development and was a perfect design for a layout that can be changed and modified further through development. These two pages, education and experience needed to be updateable and be a robust and controllable part of the site. This is the main section on which a user would come for professional information and these two pages would need to regularily kept up to date.
As this unit is about providing yourself in a strong and professional lighting I chose to create the webpage from this chosen wireframe.
I felt like this design was strong and highly maintainable. It did have issues with the navigation and these issues continued. It is hard to make this wireframe easily accessable and visible on mobile but I chose to modify the navigation bar so that on mobile device each item has its own line for space but was reletively positioned at the top of the site.

<h2>During Development</h2>
<hr>

After deciding the design to select, I began by creating the webpage.
I initially placed the navigation bar at the top of the webpage so that the user can see the structure of the site, and also be able to understand what each of the pages are to be labelled and try to begin to make the content of the pages relevant to the main title on each page.
I created the names of each of the tags to then understand which pages are to come next in the site and what they should be called and what they should discuss. Following this, I laid out the website matching a current theme and began with filling the webpages and getting the structure right.
After I had found how I would like the structure, I then began to replace the fill-in text with text corrisponding with each webpage.
Whilst during filling in the webpages I would begin to alter and set themes and styles of the webpage.
I had original gone for a strong contrast as my design was as if the user was to be on a word document, the font was to be a strong, easily readable font and not too hard on the eyes, also including alternatives to chosen fonts.
I had chosen a set font to be the font style that I wanted, through most of development. I wanted a font style with alternatives which are easy to read and allows for users with visual differences to be able to see the text.

Each of the websites where labelled with pre-determind titles for each page which was discussed during development, so that the site covers both the professional insite and a personal insite.
The titles are to guide the information which is included in each page, and allow for the information to be relative and give the user an insite to what the webpage is about. Knowing the purpose of each page and having a topic to dicuss this meant that the structure of the website would stay true to the original design. Whilst the information would vary around the webpages it would continue to follow and fit close to the wireframe that I have created.
~~#####~~
The color contrast, simplisity but professional layout means that the information is fed to the user and that there is a nice gentle layout to guide the user but not distract them. This makes sure that the user is taking in the information, the information is broken down into deep paragraphs which touch upon what the page is trying to say.

This layout stays true to the original design and keeps the form and layout even when on mobile or tablet.

Using the structure I have pre-made, I am able to keep the information guided and allow for each page to keep its structure and stay relative to the core point of the page. At the end of development the website will be checked by a CSS and HTML validator to make sure that the site has been structured and created properly. I have added some contact links to the bottom of the webpage in the contact page which connect and link to external sources such as a professional LinkdIn, and any other documents like CV and work hours. Included a contact email.
During development I create a simple skeleton layout which allowed for me to be able to modify and create the webpage as intended. Also created collapseable tables which where used to structure and layout the div containers and elements on each page which begin to become full rows and are given the full space on mobile or smaller devices if needed.
Included a profile picture for the beginning of the website and also some images on the education page to offer a logo or image to backup the company or institute that I was studying / working for. Each image is given a set size and scale to match up. Originally the images would behave irregular and wouldn't change across platform. Now after modifying the code the images are of a sufficient scale and size so that the image is viewable on mobile but not too big on table or larger devices.
I wanted to maintain and keep a sensible flow throughtout the webpage no matter how the website is viewed. This is why I continued to test every feature across devices and search engines. With the choices of the titles of each page I believe that the user is able to understand what I have began to illustrate through my webpage.

Through development at the beginning I used pre-marked text to be able to fill in the website space for each of the pages to get the size and layout of each element before filling the pages with relevant and specific information.

#INSERT

Throughout the index.html file, I have kept consistancies in naming conventions and layouts across the webpage. I have made the structure well spaced and progressive so that the HTML code can be easily read and maintained.
The structure of the file layout, is designed so that the webpage is understandable and simplified. The image assets are located inside a folder located within the parent of the index file, along with a CSS file for future CSS external files. Naming conventions across these different files are in lower-case and without spacing to allow for compatibility and universatility.

For the entire development of this project I have used GitHub to stream, upload and store my website. Whilst I have used the editor GitPod to take the project and modify it and allow for me to be able to upload and push the files back to the file repository.
Use of commenting implemented during programming to allow for other programmers to be able to understand the webpage and learn how to maintain and modify the code as they feel fit.

Once completed the README file will be placed into a word editing software to check for grammatic or spelling mistakes. This is to make sure that the README file is properly understandable and can be used to understand development and how the website was produced.

Throught this project, I have create different things on the website and as I reached the nearing the second stage of the website development, which would be changing information and filling in the pages, I also tested and viewed how the website behaved on different devices and different search engines to make sure that the website was highly compatible and maintained funcationality across different devices.
Testing is maintained throughout production of the website to make sure that it is created as intended.

During development I have tried to stick to the structure that I initially created along with the purpose and aims of the site in mind.
