<h1>Development Log</h1>
Began by creating the general structure of the webpage by creating and intitiating the HTML and CSS code.
Created a structured "hit box and bounds" basic CSS to be able to know about the
general border around the HTML elements, and be able to create and structure the elemetns accordingly.
<ul>
    <li>
        Create each of the included webpages and named them accordingly, filled them with set text to fill out the p elements to begin to see how the general layout of the pages began to look.
        Created a series of alterations to each of the CSS classess and HTML elements to begin to create my structure and theme that I designed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Began originally using HTML tables and other elements to create and set the design, due to later issues
        changed from using HTML tables. These where effective at creating structured designed, but lacked compatibility with smaller devices, like mobiles.
    </li>
    <li>
        Started to set the style and theme of each individual page and make each one have a unique and set layout according to how I wanted them presented.
    </li>
    <li>
        Struggled to make elements behave as intended, and began running a series of tests to find the best solution, began using CSS table attributes
        to make the items able to behave like they are sat in a table depending on what device is in use.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once I worked out how to fix the issues with the side-by-side layouts I then began to set the styles across the page and continued to modify and update
        different things like borders, margin and padding.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once I felt like the design was beginning to work out I removed parts of the ressessive skeleton code so that I could begin to customise the theme.
    </li>
    <li>
        Created an idea of a timeline setup for the Experience page, and began to try and create the time line using a series of different things. Effectively using a div container to just create a vertical line across a list.
    </li>
    <li>
        After a series of tests, realised a simple and effective timeline set-up where I was able to just use a ul element and li elements together to create a time line theme.
    </li>
    <li>
        Issues with the navigation bar, originally going to be fixed above the webpage but took up too much space, and intefered with the navigation bar and the hyperlinks. It covered a section of the screen once you where taken to the relevant part of the webpage.
        Chose to make it absolute instead, as this would mean users would have to scroll to the start to navigate but made the navigation bar effect.
    </li>
    <li>
        Chose to leave the navigation bar alone it is. Made it fixed on larger devices but left it as relative on smaller devices.
        This was a hard choice but I did choose to do this to save space on the screen and to make sure that users dont accidently navigate around the page with misclicking.
    </li>
    <li>
        Finalised the website with finishing both the layout and information on the overview page. Tried to give a brief but factual paragraph about myself along with some skills and interests.
    </li>
    <li>
        Also linked the bottom links in the contact section to corrisponding documents to help with for if a viewer would like to contact me.
    </li>
    <li>
        Modified the layout of the timeline. On mobile the margin difference was slightly out and needed to be altered to suit the difference of the webpage on mobile. Without the scroll bar the webpage had more space and needed values altering accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Uploaded logos for the education page so that the paragraphs have been split up and matched with a corrisponding image, also changed the Harvester logo to the M&B logo which is the mother brand company name for Harvester.
        The Harvester logo was not working properly on smaller devices and was not properly scaling to the chosen size.
    </li>
    <li>
        I finalized the webpage after finishing and correcting any issues with the webpage. I then began to translate and communicate the HTML into more semantic HTML.
        This makes your website easier to view and allows for your webpage to have an algorithmic layout. This is usually used to help programmer for future reference and also so your site can be visited by an algorithm which can search for information.
    </li>
    <li>
        Altered most of the tags to corrispond with the required result. Took aware sections of redundant code and made it simpler. Changed CSS behaviours and made then more constructive, so that they can work with the new semantic format.
    </li>
    <li>
        Had several issues with the images on this new sematic layout, they behaved differently due to the fact that there parent was an aside tag. I made them behave similar to the original div tags so that they would either float to the right or alternate sides.
        I had to change the way the pages where padded. I had to change the padding properties to each page so that it was not a set px amount but yet more of a vw, this allowed for the images and text to still give the user the feel as though the webpage was layed out like a text editor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Made two seperate classes to control the sizes of the images, one for wide images and one for square. this was to reduce image loss and make the quality better.
    </li>
    <li>
        Noticed that the summary elements are unforgiving and have small click-boxes, I incresed this area by adding a global padding to the summary css styling class.
    </li>
    <li>
        Corrected anything that the validater had flagged. Gone through the validator results and improved website layout and coding further.
