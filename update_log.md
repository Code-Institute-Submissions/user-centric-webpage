<h1>Development Log</h1>
Began by creating the general structure of the webpage by creating and intitiating the HTML and CSS code.
Created a structured "hit box and bounds" basic CSS to be able to know about the
general border around the HTML elements, and be able to create and structure the elemetns accordingly.
<ul>
    <li>
        Create each of the included webpages and named them accordingly, filled them with set text to fill out the p elements to begin to see how the general layout of the pages began to look.
        Created a series of alterations to each of the CSS classess and HTML elements to begin to create my structure and theme that I designed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Began originally using HTML tables and other elements to create and set the design, due to later issues
        changed from using HTML tables. These where effective at creating structured designed, but lacked compatibility with smaller devices, like mobiles.
    </li>
    <li>
        Started to set the style and theme of each individual page and make each one have a unique and set layout according to how I wanted them presented.
    </li>
    <li>
        Struggled to make elements behave as intended, and began running a series of tests to find the best solution, began using CSS table attributes
        to make the items able to behave like they are sat in a table depending on what device is in use.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once I worked out how to fix the issues with the side-by-side layouts I then began to set the styles across the page and continued to modify and update
        different things like borders, margin and padding.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once I felt like the design was beginning to work out I removed parts of the ressessive skeleton code so that I could begin to customise the theme.
    </li>
    <li>
        Created an idea of a timeline setup for the Experience page, and began to try and create the time line using a series of different things. Effectively using a div container to just create a vertical line across a list.
    </li>
    <li>
        After a series of tests, realised a simple and effective timeline set-up where I was able to just use a ul element and li elements together to create a time line theme.
    </li>
    <li>
        Issues with the navigation bar, originally going to be fixed above the webpage but took up too much space, and intefered with the navigation bar and the hyperlinks. It covered a section of the screen once you where taken to the relevant part of the webpage.
        Chose to make it absolute instead, as this would mean users would have to scroll to the start to navigate but made the navigation bar effect.
    </li>
</ul>
