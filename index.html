            <p>For my entire life I have loved to learn and complete projects that allow for me to be able to express my creative side. I have spent most of my time learning about technology and games and have spent countless hours on learning how to repair different varieties of tech and also create new and interesting projects. I have spent years teaching myself how to program using different online help resources and also by producing projects that would test my knowledge which I would gain over time. I love to create and design things in a very innovative way and make each project or creation unique. I like to go steps beyond and creating things that are interesting and other flexibility.</p>
            <p>I have developed my knowledge through different subjects and courses within school to be able to support and accuratly back up what I know. I wanted to be able to have levels within subjects to be able to present and show that I am able produce and create projects of different types.</p>

                <h3>About Me</h3>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>I love to learn and create new and interesting things. I am always progressive and always wanting to learn new things. Since I was young I have always been interested in technology, consoles and devices. I began to learn about programming at a young age, and would learn from different medias and online forms to increase my knowledge to use different langauges. Original began with the use of languages like Lua, and then other languages like Java, C++ and HTML. I would create simple projects within each of these languages to be able to try and improve my ability with these languages. These projects would present a range of functionality and would be made to expand my knowledge of the languages as far as I can. Since then I have began to develop my skills even further. I began within my extended studies doing a computing course, which allowed for me to be able to strengthen my knowledge of computers and programming languages. Then with the knowledge I earned from this course I also began to create and repair different consoles and devices. I would create a series of computer towers to be able to backup the knowledge I learned and actual use the knowledge within a practicle example.</p>
                <p>Since then I have continued to increase my knowledge but during this time I would also work my time within two different industries, catering, and warehouse. These jobs would be taken for a mixture of reasons either financial or to better my knowledge. I am now a qualified chef, after completing an apprenticeship. I love to eat and try new foods, so I got a qualification so I can understand how to run a kitchen and also be able to see how a kitchen functions and whats needed to keep the kitchen functioning. Whilst I worked in the kitchen, i also did a series of jobs that would be stock monitoring, control and management, which where given to me due to overly ciritical thinking about maintaing the storage zones. I also learned about how to keep to professional standards and cook on a frontline station-based kitchen, and have spend many hours working on starters and plate-up.</p>
                <p>Also one major part of my life has been to be a carer and to look after the people in my house and family. Its been a very wierd and strange upbringing but I can not deny how this has changed my personaliy and way of thinking. I have ranged from a series of tasks but generally most of the tasks throughout the house would be placed onto my todo. This is something that I have never tried to contest and in fact I think it has helped me be able to think more critically and make sure that once a task has been started it most be completed. This is one of the reasons I feel like I am more open minded and willing to learn whatever I must learn.</p>

                            <p>At the beginning of my work life. I began as agency for a local catering service, this allowed me to be able to work for many different restraunts and cafees and gave me a taste of the working world within catering. I enjoyed my time working there and learned many different things. This allowed me to work within a stressful but practical enviroment where I could begin to work under the strains and learn how to deal and cope with these types of enviroments.</p>

                            <p>This was only breif and was a job that I obtains through a warehousing agency, and this was mainly to see what the working world is like within the warehouse. This was to try and gain a grasp of what type of things happen in the warehouse.</p>

                            <p> this was for around two years, one year was to compelte an apprenticeship and the second was to continue as a chef and stil help as much as I could. I loved everything about this job and loved learning about food and what its like to be a chef for a franchise and taught me how a kitchen should be ran and how to keep up the stores standards not just within the food but everything else.</p>

                            <p>I tried finding a range of different jobs as a chef and tried to find a local pub or restraunt that could use my skills but unfortunatly after trying to reach out to these restraunts they did not meet me with the same care. So I began working back in the warehouse just to make sure that I can continue my studies and continue to obtain a form of income. This place is better than the Fullfillment Center and has more of a friendly and helpful atmosphere.</p>

                <p>I began at Hope Academy in highschool and took a series of subjects. My original intention was to obtain a computing course but had to be given an ICT subject instead. This was due to my lack of evidential ability to be able to complete this course, which later on in the sixth form I proved I already had the knowledge. Although I was given an ICT subject instead I still managed to obtain some good levels and subjects. Generally I was the highest scoring student in my side of the year and in my maths class. I obtains a B but still managed to get quiet a high score. My main subjects that I got a passing grade in are ECDL, Mathematics, ICT and then after a resit exam, English.</p>

                <p>I stayed at Hope Academy for a two more years to complete three Sixth Form courses of my choice. I chose to compelte a course for Computing Level 3 and Engineering. I also attempted to complete a Mathematics A Level and also a Health & Social Care course but due to complecations was unable to complete the course. I also managed to obtains a level in a written project. During my time here this is where I began to gain an education to backup my knowledge of computing. I got onto this course because I showed the teacher that I was more than able to perform this course and was taken on and was the main star pupil.</p>

                <p>I gained an apprenticeship at Harvester. I started a course with a team called Life Time training. Whilst there I learned everything about chefing and gained a qualification for Hospitality and Food Proudctions at a Level 2. I did this to strengthen my knowledge of the catering industry, whilst continuing to program and do things in my past time. I mainly chose this as a potential development of character, as catering is a very strong and busy place to work for and chose to this to help me learn how to do this type of job and deal with what this type of job.</p>
