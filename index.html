        This section of CSS is generalised and appears several times on both media fields.
        To simply the CSS I have removed these lines and placed them outside of the media fields to
        make them effect the webpage no matter what difference.

                            <p>I love to learn and create new and interesting things. I am always progressive and always wanting to learn new things. Since I was young I have always been interested in technology, consoles and devices. I began to learn about programming at a young age, and would learn from different medias and online forms to increase my knowledge to use different langauges. Original began with the use of languages like Lua, and then other languages like Java, C++ and HTML. I would create simple projects within each of these languages to be able to try and improve my ability with these languages. These projects would present a range of functionality and would be made to expand my knowledge of the languages as far as I can. Since then I have began to develop my skills even further. I began within my extended studies doing a computing course, which allowed for me to be able to strengthen my knowledge of computers and programming languages. Then with the knowledge I earned from this course I also began to create and repair different consoles and devices. I would create a series of computer towers to be able to backup the knowledge I learned and actual use the knowledge within a practicle example.</p>

                            <p>Since then I have continued to increase my knowledge but during this time I would also work my time within two different industries, catering, and warehouse. These jobs would be taken for a mixture of reasons either financial or to better my knowledge. I am now a qualified chef, after completing an apprenticeship. I love to eat and try new foods, so I got a qualification so I can understand how to run a kitchen and also be able to see how a kitchen functions and whats needed to keep the kitchen functioning. Whilst I worked in the kitchen, i also did a series of jobs that would be stock monitoring, control and management, which where given to me due to overly ciritical thinking about maintaing the storage zones. I also learned about how to keep to professional standards and cook on a frontline station-based kitchen, and have spend many hours working on starters and plate-up.</p>

                            <p>Also one major part of my life has been to be a carer and to look after the people in my house and family. Its been a very wierd and strange upbringing but I can not deny how this has changed my personaliy and way of thinking. I have ranged from a series of tasks but generally most of the tasks throughout the house would be placed onto my todo. This is something that I have never tried to contest and in fact I think it has helped me be able to think more critically and make sure that once a task has been started it most be completed. This is one of the reasons I feel like I am more open minded and willing to learn whatever I must learn.</p>

I began as agency for a local catering service, this allowed me to be able to work for many different restraunts and cafees and gave me a taste of the working world within catering.

This was due to my lack of evidential ability to be able to complete this course, which later on in the sixth form I proved I already had the knowledge. Although I was given an ICT subject instead I still managed to obtain some good levels and subjects. Generally I was the highest scoring student in my side of the year and in my maths class. I obtains a B but still managed to get quiet a high score. My main subjects that I got a passing grade in are ECDL, Mathematics, ICT and then after a resit exam, English.</p>

I also attempted to complete a Mathematics A Level and also a Health & Social Care course but due to complecations was unable to complete the course. I also managed to obtains a level in a written project. During my time here this is where I began to gain an education to backup my knowledge of computing. I got onto this course because I showed the teacher that I was more than able to perform this course and was taken on and was the main star pupil.</p>
